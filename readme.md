# GIF ML App ðŸŒˆ ðŸ§ 

---

### Inspiration:

I wanted to build something fun, which uses ML too. So I made this GIF webapp which loads a random GIF from Giphy and ml5 predicts what's inside that GIF. This is a weekend project so code is not super optimized

### Tech Stack:

- Typescript
- ml5.js - Friendly Machine Learning for the Web
- Giphy - To get GIFS
- Faker - To generate random tags
- Parcel - Bundler
